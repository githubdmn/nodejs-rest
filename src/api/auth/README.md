## Authentication Module

This module handles all the authentication-related operations for the application. It provides endpoints for user registration, login, password change, logout, and access token refresh. Each user is assigned a unique `authId` upon registration, which is used for subsequent authentication and authorization processes.

### Endpoints

#### POST /auth/register

This endpoint is used to register a new user. The request body should be a JSON object containing the user details. Upon successful registration, an `authId` is assigned to the user.

Request Body:

```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "email": "string"
}
```



Planning the authentication module for a Todo project involves defining the authentication requirements, selecting appropriate authentication methods, and designing the architecture to implement these requirements. Below are steps to plan the auth module for your Todo project:

1. **Define Authentication Requirements**:

   - Identify who needs access to the Todo application (e.g., users, admins).
   - Determine what actions each user role should be able to perform (e.g., create, read, update, delete todos).
   - Decide which authentication mechanisms are required (e.g., username/password, social login, JWT).

2. **Select Authentication Methods**:

   - Choose an authentication strategy based on your project requirements and security considerations.
   - Common strategies include:
     - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)
     - Session-based authentication (e.g., cookies)
     - OAuth/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication
     - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security

3. **Design Authentication Architecture**:

   - Define the components of the authentication module, such as:
     - Authentication service: Responsible for verifying user credentials, generating tokens, and managing sessions.
     - User management: Implement CRUD operations for user accounts.
     - Middleware: Secure routes by checking authentication tokens or session cookies.
     - Token management: Implement token validation, refresh token mechanism, and token expiration policies.
   - Decide where to store user credentials securely (e.g., database, external identity provider).
   - Plan how to handle authentication errors and provide appropriate error messages to users.

4. **Implement User Authentication**:

   - Develop authentication endpoints for user registration, login, logout, password reset, etc.
   - Implement middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
   - Integrate with third-party identity providers if necessary (e.g., Google, Facebook).

5. **Secure APIs and Routes**:

   - Secure API endpoints and routes by requiring valid authentication tokens or sessions.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if different user roles have different permissions.
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted over the network.

6. **Test and Validate**:

   - Test the authentication module thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
   - Perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing) to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
   - Validate user authentication flows under different scenarios (e.g., valid credentials, invalid credentials, expired tokens).

7. **Documentation and Maintenance**:
   - Document the authentication module, including usage instructions, API endpoints, and security considerations.
   - Ensure ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the authentication system to address any security vulnerabilities or updates.

By following these steps, you can effectively plan and implement the authentication module for your Todo project, ensuring that user accounts are securely managed and authenticated.

Based on the provided requirements, here are the authentication requirements for the Todo application:

1. **User Roles**:

   - **Users**: Regular users who can create, read, update, and delete their own todos.
   - **Admins**: Administrators who have additional privileges, such as managing todos for all users, managing user accounts, and performing administrative tasks.

2. **Actions for Each User Role**:

   - **Users**:
     - Create new todos
     - Read/view their own todos
     - Update/edit their own todos
     - Delete their own todos
   - **Admins**:
     - Create new todos for any user
     - Read/view todos of any user
     - Update/edit todos of any user
     - Delete todos of any user
     - Manage user accounts (e.g., create, read, update, delete users)

3. **Authentication Mechanisms**:
   - **Username/Password**: Allow users and admins to authenticate using their username/email and password.
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Use JWT for stateless authentication and authorization. Upon successful authentication, issue JWT tokens containing user roles and permissions, which can be used to access protected routes and endpoints.
   - **Social Login (Optional)**: Provide the option for users to authenticate using third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) for convenience.

With these authentication requirements in mind, you can design and implement the authentication module for the Todo application to securely manage user accounts, authenticate users, and enforce access control based on their roles and permissions.
